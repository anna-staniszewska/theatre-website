# Theatre Website

## Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by creating a theatre website.

The project I created with [Zuzanna SÅ‚obodzian](https://github.com/ZuzannaSlobodzian) aims to develop a website for the theatre. Users can view photos from previous productions, read about current events, search for specific plays or events, check details such as descriptions, pictures, terms, and actors for different plays, and reserve seats for performances by choosing seats and filling up a form.

### Features
* Landing page showcasing current events and photos from past performances
* Search functionality for finding plays or events by name
* Monthly repertoire for upcoming performances
* Seat reservation feature - user can choose seats and fill up a form

### Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
